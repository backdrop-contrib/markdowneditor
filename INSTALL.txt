Markdown Editor Installation Instructions

To get MarkdownEditor up and running, you must carry out the following
steps:

1. Make sure the BUEditor and Markdown filter modules are installed.

2. Extract the compressed file containing Markdown Editor to the module
   directory (usually sites/all/modules).

3. Install the module as you would any other.

4. Customize the editor and set up what roles may use it:
   admin/settings/bueditor
  
NOTE:   
* If you install or uninstall IMCE at a later point, you must disable,
   uninstall and reinstall the module as some code is only run at install.
   This may change for the stable release.
   
* If you make changes to the buttons and later uninstall the module, you
  changes will be LOST! To prevent that, export your buttons as a CSV file
  (see BUEditor's README for more info).
