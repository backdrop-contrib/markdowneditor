MarkdownEditor Installation Instructions

To get MarkdownEditor up and running, you must perform the following
steps:

1. Make sure the BUEditor and Markdown filter modules are installed.

2. Extract the compressed file containing MarkdownEditor.

3. Move the markdown folder from library/markdown to BUEditor's
library folder and move the icons into BUEditor's icons directory.
BUEditor is typically located at sites/all/modules/bueditor/ or
modules/bueditor/ (seen from your drupal directory.)

4. Create a new editor through the BUEditor administration interface.
It is typically located at
http://www.example.com/admin/settings/bueditor if clean URLs are enabled.

If you choose to import buttons during this step, make sure to insert
the  name of the editor before *each* form submission, otherwise you
might have to start over.

5. Go into the new editor's settings page and choose to import
buttons, select MarkdownEditorButtons.csv and submit.

6. In the field "Directory of editor library" enter:
%BUEDITOR/library/markdown

7. Scroll down below the button declarations and press Save.

8. The plugin is now good to go. You will need to refresh the settings
page once or twice if you want to make sure the demo editor works.


KNOWN BUGS:
Under certain circumstances, the editor may append empty lines at the
bottom of the editor text area.

NOTE:
There is a patch for a problem when saving buttons available at
http://drupal.org/node/151445. This patch was included in buEditor
5.x-1.1.  If you make sure to not save your buttons more than once per
import the update is not necessary, but still recommended.
