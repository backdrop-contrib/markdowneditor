MarkdownEditor Installation Instructions

To get MarkdownEditor up and running, you must perform the following
steps:

1. Make sure the BUEditor and Markdown filter modules are installed.

2. Extract the compressed file containing Markdown Editor. Browse to
the folder using your operating system's file browser (Explorer in
Windows, Finder in Mac OS X or Nautilus in Ubuntu) or use a terminal
window to move/copy the files as described below.

3. Move the markdown folder from library/markdown to BUEditor's
library folder and move the icons into BUEditor's icons directory.
BUEditor is typically located at sites/all/modules/bueditor/ or
modules/bueditor/ (seen from your drupal directory.)

4. Create a new editor through the BUEditor administration interface.
It is typically located at
admin/settings/bueditor

NOTE:
As you import the Markdown Editor buttons to BUEditor, make sure to insert
the name of the editor (markdowneditor) before *each* form submission, 
otherwise you might have to start over. The name is lost between submissions,
it's a bug in BUEditor, not Markdown Editor, that remains to be fixed.

5. Scroll down to 'Import Buttons', select 'buttons.csv'
from the directory where you extracted markdowneditor, click 'Import'.

6. Expand the 'Editor Paths' form sub section, in the field
'Directory of editor library' enter:
%BUEDITOR/library/markdown

7. Scroll down til you see the 'Save configuration' button and click it.

8. The plugin is now ready for use. You will need to refresh the settings
page once or twice if you want to make sure the demo editor works.

NOTE:
There is a patch for a problem when saving buttons available at
http://drupal.org/node/151445. This patch was included in buEditor
5.x-1.1.  If you make sure to not save your buttons more than once per
import the update is not necessary, but still recommended.
