MarkdownEditor Installation Instructions

To get MarkdownEditor up and running, you must perform the following
steps:

1. Make sure the BUEditor and Markdown filter modules are installed.
If you're using a BUEditor version older than 5.x-1.1 you will likely
experience problems. See the bottom of this file for more information
on this.

2. Extract the compressed file containing MarkdownEditor.

3. Move the markdown folder from library/markdown to BUEditor's
library folder and move the icons into BUEditor's icons directory.
BUEditor is typically located at sites/all/modules/bueditor/ or
modules/bueditor/ (seen from your drupal directory.)

This implies that you have to name your editor markdown in order for
the JS files to load properly. If you want the files to load for every
editor you should put the files directly into bueditor/library/
(without any subdirectories). See bueditor/library/README.txt  for
more information.


4. Create a new editor through the BUEditor administration interface.
It is typically located at
http://www.example.com/admin/settings/bueditor if clean URLs are enabled.

If you choose to import buttons during this step, make sure to insert
the  name of the editor before *each* form submission, otherwise you
might have to start over.

5. Go into  the  new editor's  settings  page and  choose to  import
buttons, select MarkdownEditorButtons.csv and submit.

6. Scroll down below the button declarations and press Save.

7. The plugin is now good to go. You will need to refresh the settings
page once or twice if you want to make sure the demo editor works.


KNOWN BUGS:
Under certain circumstances, the editor may append empty lines at the
bottom of the editor text area.
If you experience problem using this editor, please file an issue in its
project page's issue tracker at drupal.org. Please include detailed
instructions so that we can recreate the problem and effectively analyze
and fix it.

NOTE:
There is a patch for a problem when saving buttons available at
http://drupal.org/node/151445. This patch was included in buEditor
5.x-1.1.  If you make sure to not save your buttons more than once per
import the update is not necessary, but still recommended.
